# sensorAppFinal

This project is my uni work as it is used for farms to reach the backlog of weather and rain situation on Cyprus.

The app consists of different pages: 
first is /sensor/registration where you basically put your position
second is /measurements where all measurements are printed
third is /measurements/add to put a new measurement
fourth is /measurement/rainyDaysCount to check how many rainy days there were
